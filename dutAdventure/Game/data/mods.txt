Mod listing -- EDIT ONLY WITH GREAT CARE OR THE GAME WILL BREAK

Format:
  [mod ID, nonnegative integer]
  [space]
  [optional: requirement code, followed by space]
  [optional: ordering value, defaults to 1000, followed by space]
  [foreslash followed by directory name with trailing slash]
    (always use foreslashes, even on Windows)
    NO TRAILING SPACES!  Spaces in path OK.
  [new line; \r\n, \r or \n acceptable]

Requirement codes
  R+ = unlocked [unnecessary, but keeps lines looking neat]
  R- = locked [only unlockable by editing this file]
  RI## = Requires item number ##
  RA## = Requires weapon number ##
  RG = requires beating hell

Ordering values are P with a nonnegative integer appended
  example: "P13"
